### This is a checker game made with pygame.

### Rules are simple

### Objective:

# Capture all of the opponent's pieces or block them so they cannot make a move.

### Movement:

# Pieces can only move diagonally on dark square

# Pieces can only move forward. Once they become "King" by the last row of opponent side they can move freely diagonally.

### Capturing:

# Capture an opponent's piece by jumping over it to an empty square directly beyond it.

# Multiple captures are allowed in a single turn (multi-jump) if possible

### Additional Rules:

# If a player can make a capture, they must do so (forced capture rule).

# The game can end in a stalemate if neither player can make a legal move.
